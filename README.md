### DIFFIE-HELLMAN SIMULATOR

Diffie-Hellman Simulator (DHS) is a simple script meant to demonstrate how a Diffie-Hellman Exchange works.
Included is a Prime Number Generator, PrimeGen.py, which can be used as a standalone script to generate
both an all-inclusive list of prime numbers, as well as a subset of primes known as "safe primes" or 
Sophie Germain primes.

Feel free to use these scripts for educational purposes, or for your own amusement.
